# Shorty Awards filtering with JSON Server

1. Run `npm run backend` in the terminal to start a json server.
2. Open a second terminal (by clicking the `[+]` icon) and run `npm run frontend` to start a http server that serves html files.
3. On the left Stackblitz sidebar select `Ports in use` to list all working ports. Json server uses `Port 3000` while http server runs on the `Port 8080`. You can click a port to open it.
